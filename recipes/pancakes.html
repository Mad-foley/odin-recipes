    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3tbs. white sugar</li>
      <li>3tsp. baking powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2tsp. baking soda</li>
      <li>3/4tsp. salt</li>
      <li>3cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>1/2cup milk</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1/3cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk,
        milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
