    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>1/2cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, blend together softened butter, 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup sugar. 
        Press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden. 
        In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour. 
        Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice. Pour over the baked crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven. The bars will firm up as they cool. 
        For a festive tray, make another pan using limes instead of lemons and adding a drop of green food coloring to give a very pale green. 
        After both pans have cooled, cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board fashion.
